## Backend Django-Rest-Framework 
Django Rest Framework is the backend API service used for [Events Social Media](https://github.com/bky201/events-api.git). This section is mainly used for data storage, receiving requests from the client side and sending back a responses to client/webpage to render the webpage.


## Main Goals

The main goal of this website is to develop social media website that can provide event's photo sharing with other users online and get back rating and reviews other users. This can make it easy for users to follow up their freinds and get more information about users they follow. The site provides users with all the necessary information on user profile and rating and reviews.

## Agile Methodology Plane 

The foundation of this project is built upon Agile methodologies, where each feature block is delivered during a specific sprint. This project consists of two sprints, with stories being allocated to epics for better organization. The workflow is managed through a Kanban board created using GitHub Projects. It's worth noting that all stories come with a comprehensive set of well-defined conditions or requirements that must be met for a user story to be considered complete and ready for evaluation or acceptance.
